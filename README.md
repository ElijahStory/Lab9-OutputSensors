# Lab 9: General Output Sensors
In this lab, you will learn to use your choice of  1 output sensors, so that you can output something other than light. 

## Steps
0. Explanation of your lanterns to class
1. Exploration of Sensor 1
2. [EXTRA] Exploration of Sensor 2
3. Use both output sensors
4. Make your code from last week, the RGB LED / Push button joint code more concise or efficient. Use functions or classes. 
## To Submit
Upload the following to your google drive folder or link to your file via github. Only the code needed to take in input is necessary - feel free to use an LED to show that input was received, or take a screenshot of print statements that show that the values are getting through. In the case of a print statement, it needs to state what the values we see are as well as state the 

### 1: Explore Sensor 1
1. State your first output sensor of choice. Why did you choose it? Did you make use of all of it's capabilities. If not, which capabilities did you use, and what drove that choice? Do you understand where to find more data on how to use these sensors?
2. Describe what how you got input from this sensor.
- Electrical diagram with explanation
- Written explanation of how your code works
- Picture of your setup
- Video of what is happening
- Properly commented code, zipped, with naming scheme: Lab9_Sensor1_FirstName_LastName 
3. Document any difficulties you ran into. How did you fix them? Links/screenshots or brief written descriptions as appropriate. If there were none, say so. 
4. What would you need to do to use this input in your lantern design?
### 2: Explore Sensor 2 [EXTRA CREDIT]
1. State your second output sensor of choice. Why did you choose it? Did you make use of all of it's capabilities. If not, which capabilities did you use, and what drove that choice? Do you understand where to find more data on how to use these sensors?
2. Describe what how you got input from this sensor.
- Electrical diagram with explanation
- Written explanation of how your code works
- Picture of your setup
- Video of what is happening
- Properly commented code, zipped, with naming scheme: Lab9_Sensor2_FirstName_LastName 
3. Document any difficulties you ran into. How did you fix them? Links/screenshots or brief written descriptions as appropriate.
4. What would you need to do to use this input in your lantern design?
### 3: Combining Sensors
Combine your new output sensor with one of the other sensors you have used. Create a joint product.
1. Draw a electrical diagram that shows how to connect both sensors into one working circuit.  Explain what is happening. 
2. Set up the circuit. Take pictures. 
3. Write the code that combines all of these. Explain your code
### 4, version A: The Swiss Army Knife of Lanterns
Complete your lantern design. 
1. Use all 4 sensors (2 outputs, 2 inputs) with your lanter. Show code. Show electrical diagram. Put all sensors together in the system. Build the lantern. Bring in the lantern. 
2. Document any difficulties / issues.  If there were none, say so. 
### 4, version B: Lantern & Other
1. Build your lantern, using one input & output pair of sensors. Show code. Show electrical diagram. Build the lantern. Bring in the lantern. 
2. Create something else, using at minimum the other input and output you explored. Show code. Show electrical diagram. Use this in something "creative" and well displayed. It should not be an open circuit board. Wires should be hidden, everything should be nicely packaged physically, as well as useable, and electrically safe.
